Energy Efficiency
- How could make efficient?
- Activate part of the system.
- Why does it have to be on all the time.

Explain more about last sentence in background paragraph.

Restrict scope to physical spaces, not whole pervasive.

So talk about continuum of devices. Provide a context.
There's a gap in the middle. Especially in the computational context. There's a spectrum.

2 ways to map it.
- Continuum of devices.
- Space-time continuity.

- Small bits of data and small bits of code.

What piece of the pervasive model.


Draw a diagram, with different dimensions.
- Where RFID is getting used at the moment. Where it could be used for.
- Compare with other technologies. Where they fit in the spectrum.


- Fault tolerance of chip.
- Aging curve. Long term analysis.
- Convincing argument about graceful degradation.
- Elasticticity of it.
