We consider using passive RFID technology beyond its traditional purpose, namely, identification. Instead we consider passive tags being densely distributed in space, providing the infrastructure for distributed, physical information systems. These systems form the basis for continuous pervasive spaces. In such a space, a user perceives services with full continuity. That is, tags are densely distributed in the space. The granularity is so high that a user does not perceive the discreteness. As users equipped with interrogators move through the space, they interact with the tags by reading from and writing to their storages. As a result, information flows through the tags. The resulting services are continuously presented to the user in space-time, since the tags themselves are pervasive.

RFID tag multiplicity is a necessary component, and it is the unique supporting solution that enables the design and implementation of continuous pervasive spaces.
